#### In this repository you can find the projects and problem sets I have solved on the CS50 introduction to computer science and CS50 Web programming with Python & Javascript course.

### CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home

The branches beginning with WEB50 are from the course I am currently undertaking. 

These projects have been built in Visual studio code, and will run from the terminmal with "python3 manage.py runserver" or "python manage.py runserver".


### CS50's Introduction to Computer Science - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home

The branches beginning with CS50 are from the first course, these projects were made in an online IDE. The link for the IDE is https://ide.cs50.io/5bf64dc13b7b4921a953f5da530ba6c7 - i will need to approve your Github username to see the projects. 

Throughout the problem sets you will find small programs written in C and Python. 

The two projects ..... are in the files "project" and "pset9" -> "finance".

##### "Project'
The project in "project" is a card game built with HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, FLASK & SQLite3. In the terminal of the IDE, run "flask run" to launch the website. 

##### "Finance"
The project in "finance" is a website which allows you to buy and sell stocks, keeping track of your portfolio. 
Before running "flask run" run - export API_KEY=pk_1ce4a1da65f44c49aba989150ed4c67a
