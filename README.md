#### In this repository you can find the projects and problem sets I have solved on the CS50 introduction to computer science and CS50 Web programming with Python & Javascript course.

### CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home

The branches beginning with WEB50 are from the course I am currently undertaking. 

These projects have been built in Visual studio code, and will run from the terminmal with "python3 manage.py runserver" or "python manage.py runserver".
Below i have listed the projects from this course, clicking the link above will tell you more about their functionality and the expecations when building the website. 

#### Wikipedia
This is a basic website, allowing users to create new pages, and add information regarding this topic. This content can then be edited by other users much like Wikipedia. 

#### Commerce
A website similar to Ebay. Allowing users to log in, list items, other users can bid on an item and when the seller closes the listing they are informed of who won. Users can also create wishlists, and comment on listings. This project is built with Django, its models and SQLITE. 

#### Mail
This website allowers users to send emails to other users registered on the site. This website runs primarily with Javscript on the client side with Python & Django fulfilling the requests on the backend.

#### Network
This is a social media website emulating Twitter. Here users can log in, create posts "Tweets", users can follow each other, like each others posts. By default the homepage loads all users posts, but clicking the following tab, will load just the users they are following. 


### CS50's Introduction to Computer Science - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home

The branches beginning with CS50 are from the first course, these projects were made in an online IDE. The link for the IDE is https://ide.cs50.io/5bf64dc13b7b4921a953f5da530ba6c7 - i will need to approve your Github username to see the projects. 

Throughout the problem sets you will find small programs written in C and Python. 

The two projects ..... are in the files "project" and "pset9" -> "finance".

#### Project
The project in "project" is a card game built with HTML, CSS, JS, PYTHON, FLASK & SQLite3. In the terminal of the IDE, run "flask run" to launch the website. 

#### Finance
The project in "finance" is a website which allows you to buy and sell stocks, keeping track of your portfolio. 
Before running "flask run" run - export API_KEY=pk_1ce4a1da65f44c49aba989150ed4c67a
